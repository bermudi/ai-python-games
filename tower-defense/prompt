Create a sophisticated tower defense game using Pygame and PIL for custom sprite generation. This project emphasizes advanced programming concepts, custom graphics generation, and game architecture design.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Sprite Generation System (Advanced)
- Implement a sprite factory using PIL that generates ALL game graphics programmatically
- Required sprite categories:
  - At least 4 tower types with distinct visual designs
  - 5+ enemy types with procedurally generated variations
  - Projectiles with particle effects
  - Environmental elements (terrain features)
  - UI elements
- Each sprite must include animation frames
- Implement a caching system for generated sprites to optimize performance

### 2. Advanced Tower Mechanics
- Minimum 4 tower types with unique behaviors:
  - Primary attack mechanism
  - Secondary ability
  - Upgrade paths (minimum 3 levels each)
  - Area of effect capabilities
- Tower synergy system where towers buff nearby allies
- Tower targeting priorities with at least 3 AI strategies
- Heat map generation for tower placement efficiency

### 3. Enemy System
- Enemy wave generator using a genetic algorithm to create increasingly challenging waves
- Enemy types must include:
  - Basic units
  - Flying units
  - Armored units
  - Healing/Support units
  - Boss units with unique abilities
- Enemy behavior patterns using state machines
- Path-finding algorithm implementation (A* or similar)
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on player performance
